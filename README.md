# KirdowAI
Test project made to learn AI, specifically LLM models. Base code generated by ChatGPT then expanded upon by me. The data I use comes from logs we have from our discord server over the course of 4 years. This data is only ever used privately and won't be available here. Bring your own data. However assuming you got a directory called `inputlogs` filled with `.log` files, just edit the regex inside of `logregex.txt` and you should be good to go. 

These are the files used:
1. `python3 preprocess.py <filter name> [limit latest # entries]` or `python3 preprocess.py -- <limit latest # entries | 0 = disabled> [<blacklist name>[ ...]]` for gethering training data from logs
2. `python3 training.py <filter name>` or `python3 training.py --` to train the model
3. `python3 main.py <filter name>` or `python3 main.py --` to run/use the model

If you just cloned the repository, you can run `python3 preprocess.py --` once and it should generate all the required files and folders mentioned at the start. You will still need to provide your own `.log` files though.

The required libraries is up to you to figure out. For reference I'm using Python 3.9.19 and I'm installing that through Anaconda/Miniconda.
