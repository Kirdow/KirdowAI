# KirdowAI
Test project made to learn AI, specifically LLM models. Base code generated by ChatGPT then expanded upon by me. The data I use comes from logs we have from our discord server over the course of 4 years. This data is only ever used privately and won't be available here. Bring your own data. However assuming you got a directory called `inputlogs` filled with `.log` files, just edit the regex inside of `preprocess.py` and you should be good to go.
